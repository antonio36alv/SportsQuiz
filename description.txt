I want a quizzing platform that allows a user to make a quiz

When making a quiz I want the option for it to be an open quiz or a way to restrict partipipants via a generated code for the quiz and for each participant (particpant code is unique for each participant)
 
I want a Google authentication

I want three types of questions: mulitple choice, multiple choice with images, and open ended

I want to be able to link a youtube video or a picture relevant to the question

I want a timer for the quiz with the option for unlimited time

I want a game mode where I can set the option for reducing time left, based on the quiz makers' desired time penalty

Quiz makers should be able to save quizes that they have not finished creating

If time is unlimited quiz takers may come back to the quiz
