## Project Description

The goal for this project was to create a webpage that serves as a quiz. The user clicks start to begin the game. Questions are picked only once per game, at random. The timer starts at 75 seconds and there are penalties to answering the questions wrong. Each game ends when either all the questions have been answered or the timer runs out. There are displays for the timer, correct answers and wrong answers, which are updated as the game goes on. Depending on the users performance they may or may not get an oppurtunity to record a high score. If they do they are presented with a text box at the bottom to enter their name. There is a button to show the high scores entered.
